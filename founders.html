                        <p class="text-gray-600">My name is Tala Swaidan. I am a year 10 student at GEMS Metropole School, Motor city, and I have the great honor and privilege of serving 
                            as the Founder and Secretary-General of Voices of the Future Model United Nations (VOFMUN). VOFMUN all began as a lighthearted and funny idea shared among friends, 
                            but with time, dedication, and great effort, it grew into something far more meaningful; a platform for courageous MUN diplomats to engage in diplomacy, express 
                            their perspectives, and take on global issues with confidence and purpose. Beyond my work with VOFMUN, I am an active member of my school's Student Council and 
                            have been deeply involved in Model United Nations for several years. I also pursue my passions in sports, particularly basketball and kickboxing with MVP recognitions, 
                            which have both taught me the value of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. I hope to expand my horizons during the next academic year, along with working on the development 
                            of the first VOFMUN conference, taking place in the January of 2026. Through all my endeavors, I strive to foster positive change, empower others, and lead with integrity. 
                            As VOFMUN continues to grow, my hope is that it remains a space where young leaders can find their voice, challenge their thinking, and leave inspired to shape a better world. 
                            I'm incredibly proud of how far we've come — and even more excited for what's ahead. See you soon!</p>

                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 font-medium mb-2">Head of Finance and Fundraising</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Hello! My name is Tamara Moshawrab, and I'm currently a Year 11 student at SABIS International school of  Choueifat Dubai. I'm honored to be apart 
                            of the secretariat of Voices of the Future Model UN, serving as the Head of Finance! Taking on this role has allowed me to combine two things I genuinely enjoy: being 
                            part of an ambitious team and applying practical financial thinking to real-world scenarios. Academically, I've chosen to study IGCSE Business and AP Economics because 
                            I'm deeply interested in understanding how global markets operate and how economic policy can shape the world we live in. These subjects also support my long-term goal 
                            of becoming a lawyer, as I believe a strong foundation in business and economics will help me approach legal challenges with a more well-rounded perspective. Outside of 
                            class, I'm passionate about debate and MUN—there's something about public speaking, critical thinking, and global problem-solving that pushes me to grow every time I 
                            participate. I'm also a tennis player, which keeps me grounded and helps me stay focused and disciplined. Being part of the journey of VOFMUN has already been such a 
                            wonderful and positive experience, and I'm excited to help manage our resources to ensure this year's conference is not just successful and memorable, but unforgettable. 
                            We hope to see you there!</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">I'm Noaf Qassem, a Year 11 student at SABIS International School of Choueifat Dubai, and I'm incredibly proud to be serving as the Deputy Head of Finance 
                            of Voices of the Future 2026! Being part of the VOFMUN leadership has given me the opportunity to contribute to something meaningful while building valuable skills in organization, 
                            teamwork, and strategic planning. I've chosen to take IGCSE Business, AP Economics, and AP Statistics—subjects that reflect my deep interest in global systems, economic theory, and 
                            data-driven decision-making. My future aspirations lie in either diplomacy or economics, and I believe that understanding the mechanics of both global policy and financial systems 
                            will prepare me to make a real impact in those fields. MUN has always been a space where I've been able to grow—not just as a speaker and thinker, but as a global citizen. I love 
                            the way it challenges me to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with others to solve complex issues. Outside of academics, I am an ongoing track and field athelete, 
                            which helps shape my perspective on core life skills such as discipline, leadership, and respect. Being part of the VOFMUN team and this great journey has been incredibly exciting, and 
                            I'm committed to ensuring the financial planning behind the scenes helps make this conference as smooth, impactful, and unforgettable as possible. Can't wait to see what we accomplish 
                            together—hope to see you a VOFMUN 2026!</p>
